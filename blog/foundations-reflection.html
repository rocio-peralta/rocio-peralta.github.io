    <h3> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3> <br>
        <p>
          What I learned about my ego is how high we can go when everything is going well, and how easy it is to crush it when things get a little bit challenging. Therefore, it is important to be conscious of our state of mind at the moment and try to maintain a realistic equilibrium.

        </p><br>
         
      <h3> What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3> <br>
       
        <p>
          Learning programming is such a challenging task that it will put you in some uncomfortable situations. You will find yourself being hard on yourself because you have read and understood the theory, but you are still not able to write a line of code with your knowledge. In moments like these, empathy that you have for yourself plays a key role in your learning journey. You do have to push yourself to go further, but also understand that learning new, and in some cases abstract, ideas may require you to put into action parts of your brain that are a little bit rusty or not yet well-developed.

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about core learning?
      </h3> <br> 
        <p>
          I normally don't like this type of thing and saw it as a waste of time because I don't enjoy writing about myself and similar topics. However, I soon realized the importance of core learning. It is crucial to address feelings at the beginning of our learning journal since they play such a key role. Most of the time, I feel that they provide me with the right advice for the upcoming week. Additionally, the activities in the core encourage me to talk and connect with my peers on Discord. Overall, they are well thought out.

      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3> <br> 
      <p>
        In the beginning, I was a little stressed out about the time box because I forgot to use it and also took more time than I should have. Then, with time, I realized that I'm not going to always stick to the time box, but it's really nice to have an idea of how long a task is going to take so you can plan better.

      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3> <br> 
      <p>
        In your programming journey, you can easily get frustrated or have thoughts that can pull you down. Before joining Dev Academy, I was trying to study by myself, and one of the reasons I couldn’t go further is because I didn’t address my ego, my feelings, and I didn’t have the support that I found here.
      </p><br>
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer. </h3> <br> 
      <p>
        Sometimes it does, but in the end, you see the benefits of exposing your feelings out there and connecting with people. Probably without the Core, I would still be behind the screen, too shy to ask for help
