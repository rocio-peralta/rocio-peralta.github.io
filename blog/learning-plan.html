    <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1><br>
        <p>My long-term goal is to become a successful developer in the tech industry. Through this course, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the industry and its various branches, so that I can make an informed decision about which area of the industry I want to specialize in. Additionally, I plan to use my existing skills in programming and problem-solving to excel in this field. As I continue to learn and explore new technologies, my goal is to become a leader in the industry and contribute to the development of innovative software solutions that improve people's lives.</p><br>

    <h1>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h1><br>
        <p>I work well under pressure and enjoy a challenge. I can stay calm and focused to make fast decisions and keep projects on track. I am a positive team player who is always ready to help others. If a teammate needs support, I will go out of my way to offer guidance and help them succeed. I believe that a strong team supports each other through all situations.</p>
        <p>I am good at solving problems, but sometimes I have trouble asking for help when I need it. I know that working with others can help us find better solutions. I feel embarrassed to ask for help, but I am trying to change that. I know that asking for help is a sign of strength and can help me learn and grow.</p>
        <p> also tend to compare myself to others, which can make me feel self-conscious about my progress. To overcome this, I set personal goals and focus on my own growth and development. This helps me stay motivated and achieve my objectives.</p><br>

    <h1>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
        <p>I want to improve my communication skills and develop healthy habits for remote work. This means working on how I communicate with others and making sure I have good habits for staying productive while working from home or other remote locations.</p>

    <h1>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
     An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h1><br>
        <p>I believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is important, and that includes working reasonable hours and avoiding burnout. I also understand the value of having a clean and organized workspace, as it can help me stay focused and productive. To develop good habits, I plan to establish a set routine and work during consistent hours.</p><br>
        <p>Additionally, I recognize that engaging with others and being an active member of my community can be beneficial. On Discord, I plan to participate more by hanging out in the lounge and offering help to others when I can. By being an active member, I can learn from others, share knowledge, and build relationships.</p><br>

    <h1>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</h1><br>
        <p>It's important to seek help as soon as possible, before things escalate and become harder to manage. Don't wait until it's too late to ask for assistance. Taking action early can make a big difference in preventing problems from getting worse.</p><br>

    <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h1><br>
        <p>If I get stuck on a task or error for more than 40 minutes, I will ask for help from other students or facilitators instead of continuing to struggle on my own.</p><br>

    <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h1><br>
        <p>I expect my facilitators to be available to help me with technical issues during reasonable hours. They have also shared wise words with me during our Tuesday Zoom meetings, which I appreciate.</p><br>

    <h1>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1><br>
        <p>My birthday is on Monday the 17th, so I plan to take the morning off and work a half day. To make this possible, I will start working on Sunday to get ahead on my tasks.</p><br>
