      <h3> Block on a simple problem</h3> <br>
        <p>
          This week I got  stuck on a simple problem. It was about accessing an array inside a property object. I felt like it was an easy thing to do, but for some reason, I just couldn't figure it out.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          To solve the problem, I used some techniques like Googling the specific thing that I wanted to do and watching a video with Joseph where he showed how he broke a problem down into little steps. I realized that I shouldn't get overwhelmed with the whole picture, but instead take it step by step and find a way to do little things.
        </p><br>
        <p> 
          Throughout the process, I felt a bit frustrated because I knew it was a simple thing, and it made me doubt my general knowledge. But I learned that I shouldnâ€™t think that there's something that I don't know and that the answer might be something complicated. Keep it simple.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I also learned that sometimes reading the code as a text can be helpful, and the logic behind it might not be what you expect. So, always try to break down problems into smaller steps, and don't be afraid to ask for help or look things up online.
        </p><br><br>

      <h3> Elegantly solved a problem</h3> <br>
        <p>
          So,  last week I got stuck on this media query exercise where we had to select a class and return its length. I didn't know what to do, but I didn't suffer in silence. Instead, I went out of my comfort zone and asked a facilitator for help.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Throughout the process, I wasn't exactly frustrated, but the problem was really bothering me. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I realized that obsessively thinking about the problem wasn't helping me. So, I left it alone, put my mind on something else, and then came back to it later with a fresh, clear mind. That helped me a lot more. Even though obsessive thinking can feel satisfying, it rarely helps me solve the problem.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          What I learned from this experience is that I don't always have to build everything from scratch with a loop. There's probably a method that already does what I want to do. So, now I try to combine methods or find one that does what I need.
        </p><br>  
         
      <h3> Problem-solving techniques/processes</h3> <br>
       
        <p>
          During this sprint, I feel a lot more confident in my problem-solving skills. There are several techniques that have really helped me out. For example, learning how to read error messages has been a game-changer. When there's a problem, the console guides me in the right direction. Instead of rewriting all the code, I can just focus on the line that's causing the issue.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Trying something is another technique that's been really useful. Sometimes, I'll just make a small change like swapping the order of lines or adding a "." and it actually works! It might be by luck, but then I can focus on understanding why it works that way.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Googling is another key technique, but it's important to read the results carefully. I've found that other people often have the exact same problem as me and have already posted solutions. And when I'm really stuck, asking peers or coaches for help has been a lifesaver.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Finally, reflecting on my problem-solving process has helped me improve even further. I can look back at what worked and what didn't, and then adjust my approach for next time. 
        </p><br>
      <h3>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so</h3>
        <p>
          I got stuck on a JavaScript exercise. I didn't want to ask for help because I wanted to find the solution for myself. My ego said that if I do everything by myself, it will grow bigger. Previously, in the learning plan exercise, I had said that one of my strategies would be to ask for help if I get stuck on something for more than 40 minutes. After a day and a half of trying, that exercise was the last one I needed to complete the sprint for the week. I saw that one of the facilitators was holding a meeting with another student and I remembered my learning plan, so I decided to join them. I finished feeling proud of myself not for finding the solution, but for learning how to ask for help.</p><br>
