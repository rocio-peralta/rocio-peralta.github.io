    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1> 
    
    <p> A few years ago, we thought that you were born with certain capacities and that the brain stayed the same for the rest of your life. Recently, the concept of neuroplasticity has been introduced, which exposes the idea that you can change your brain and enhance the parts that you desire. Our brains are like big sponges; they can rewire themselves and form new connections. This means that our brains can change based on our experiences, behaviors, and even our thoughts. So, if you learn something new or practice a skill, your brain can create new connections to make that task easier for you in the future. Similarly, if you stop using a skill, those connections can weaken or disappear, just like a language you haven't spoken for years - if you donâ€™t use it, you lose it. As we learn and practice new things, it's like paving new roads or adding new routes to the network. Similarly, if we stop using a skill or stop taking a particular route, it's like that road becoming overgrown and forgotten. Our brains are constantly changing and adapting, just like a road system that evolves over time to meet the needs of its users.</p>
